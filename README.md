# Sousou no Frieren Console Game
## Please read the README.md inside the release package
A console game written in Java, simulating the map and navigating the main character, Frieren, around the map.

Information taken from [Frieren: Beyond Journey's End Wiki](https://frieren.fandom.com/).

Currently in development, so the game might have bugs and unchanged variables and values.

Inspired by [TheMaraudersMap](https://github.com/COE312L-Team1/TheMaraudersMap).

Feel free to add anything to the program, as it's open source.



## Please check the Release for the first compile version of the code!
